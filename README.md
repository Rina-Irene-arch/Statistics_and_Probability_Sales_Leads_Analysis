# Statistics and Probability Final Assignment: Sales Leads Analysis
In this [project](https://github.com/Rina-Irene-arch/Statistics_and_Probability_NAYA_Assignment/blob/main/Naya_DRA_Statistics_Final_Assignment_Rina_Rafalski_D_Fin.ipynb) we analyze data from 10,000 sales leads to examine the company's sales performance of a recently launched health insurance product.
The [data source](https://github.com/Rina-Irene-arch/Statistics_and_Probability_NAYA_Assignment/blob/main/DRA%20Final%20Assignment%20Data.csv) of gathered the data contains the following parameters:
- ID – a unique identifier of each customer
- AGE GROUP – the age group of the customer
- CHANNEL OF SALE – either “internet” or “phone”, depending on where the customers left their contact
details
- SALES – an indicator variable (1 – successful sale, 0 – unsuccessful sale)
### Question 1
data source: [DRA Final Assignment Data.csv](https://github.com/Rina-Irene-arch/Statistics_and_Probability_NAYA_Assignment/blob/main/DRA%20Final%20Assignment%20Data.csv)
- **1.01 Probability: task 1**
   - PDF of the 10,000 leads by AGE GROUP and by CHANNEL OF SALE
- **1.02 Probability: task 2**
   - Plot the probability distribution function (PDF) for AGE GROU
- **1.03 Combinatorics & Joint distribution: task 1**
   - How many combinations of AGE GROUP and CHANNEL OF SALE do you expect to see?
- **1.04 Combinatorics & Joint distribution: task 2**
   - Calculate the joint distribution of leads by AGE GROUP and CHANNEL OF SALE
- **1.05 Combinatorics & Joint distribution: task 3**
   - Plot the distribution by AGE GROUP for each CHANNEL OF SALE separately
- **1.06 Conditional probability: task 1**
   - Given that a person belongs to a specific age group, calculate the probability that they will choose to use each CHANNEL OF SALE 
- **1.07 Conditional probability: task 2**
   - Comment on your results – is there a recommendation regarding the CHANNEL OF SALE preference of each group that you can give?
- **1.08 Statistical tests – Chi square for independence: task 1**
   - <details>
      The company wishes to examine the dependence/independence between the choice of CHANNEL OF SALE and the SALES indicator.<br>
      Perform a Chi square test of independence between CHANNEL OF SALE and the SALES indicator.<br>
      - What are the null and alternative hypotheses of this test?<br>
      - Calculate the P-value of the test and state your conclusion at a 5% significance level and at a 1% significance level.
- **1.09 Random variables & CLT: task 1**
   - <details>
      The company wishes to calculate its expected profit:<br>
      - It spends 45$ on acquiring each sales lead<br>
      - Price of each sale is 86$<br>
      Calculate the minimal number of sales (out of 10,000 leads) required to make a profit
- **1.10 Random variables & CLT: task 2**
   - <details>
      The company decides to model the total amount of sales using a Binomial random variable<br>
      - Where n=10,000<br>
      - And p is estimated from the SALES column<br>
      Estimate the value of p
- **1.11 Random variables & CLT: task 3**
   - Using the Binomial random variable, calculate the probability of the total amount of sales being smaller than the number required to make a profit
- **1.12 Random variables & CLT: task 4**
   - Using the Normal approximation of the Binomial random variable, calculate the same probability
- **1.13 Random variables & CLT: task 5**
   - <details>
      Plot the two distributions together – Binomial as bars, Normal as line (you may choose the Xaxis range which is best suitable for your plot). Comment on the appropriateness of the approximation
- **1.14 Random variables & CLT: task 6**
   - The risk manager said: “if we have 0 sales we will lose $450,000 which is very risky for a new product!”. Comment on his statement
### Question 2 
data source: [DRA Final Assignment Data RAND.csv]
- 2.01 Simulation: task 1
- 2.02 Simulation: task 2
- 2.03 Simulation: task 3
### Question 3
- 3.01 Time series & A/B Testing: task 1
- 3.02 Time series & A/B Testing: task 2
- 3.03 Time series & A/B Testing: task 3
- 3.04 Time series & A/B Testing: task 4
- 3.05 Time series & A/B Testing: task 5
- 3.06 Time series & A/B Testing: task 6
   <details>
          Calculate the probability distribution function (PDF) of the 10,000 leads by AGE GROUP and by CHANNEL OF SALE separately (present your findings as the percent of each group out of 10,000)
